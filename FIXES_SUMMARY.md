# UI Forge Studio - Critical Fixes & Enhancements

## 🛠️ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Movement & Cursor Tracking Issues** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Moving UI elements didn't follow the cursor and moved in annoying directions.

**Solution**:

- Completely rewrote drag handling in `CanvasComponent.tsx`
- Added proper cursor offset calculation based on mouse position relative to component
- Fixed coordinate system to use canvas-relative positioning
- Improved movement precision with proper boundary checking

**Technical Changes**:

```typescript
// New approach: Calculate offset from mouse to component top-left
const offsetX = e.clientX - rect.left;
const offsetY = e.clientY - rect.top;

// Move relative to canvas with proper offset accounting
const newX = (e.clientX - canvasRect.left - dragStart.x) / zoom;
const newY = (e.clientY - canvasRect.top - dragStart.y) / zoom;
```

### 2. **Properties Panel Scrolling** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Properties panel was not scrolling properly.

**Solution**:

- Added proper height constraints with `h-full`
- Fixed flex layout with `flex-shrink-0` for headers
- Added `min-h-0` to enable proper overflow behavior
- Ensured proper container sizing

**Technical Changes**:

```typescript
<div className="w-80 bg-white border-l border-gray-200 flex flex-col h-full">
  <div className="p-4 border-b border-gray-200 flex-shrink-0">
  <div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto min-h-0">
```

### 3. **Component Hierarchy & Tree Structure** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Problem**: No proper tree-like component hierarchy visualization.

**Solution**:

- Added `parentId` property to Component interface
- Implemented proper tree structure building in LayerPanel
- Added expand/collapse functionality for nested components
- Visual hierarchy with indentation and connection lines
- Parent-child relationship indicators

**Technical Changes**:

```typescript
// Added to Component interface
export interface Component {
  // ... existing properties
  parentId?: string; // NEW: Parent relationship
}

// Tree building logic
const rootComponents = components.filter((component) => !component.parentId);
const buildComponentTree = (component: Component): Component[] => {
  return components.filter((c) => c.parentId === component.id);
};
```

### 4. **Enhanced Layer Panel** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Features Added**:

- **Hierarchical Tree View**: Proper parent-child relationships
- **Expand/Collapse Controls**: Fold and unfold components
- **Component Details**: Shows component name, type, and child count
- **Visual Indicators**: Dots for leaf nodes, chevrons for expandable nodes
- **Interactive Controls**: Hide/show, lock/unlock, delete buttons
- **Improved Styling**: Better hover states and selection indicators

**UI Improvements**:

- Clear visual hierarchy with indentation
- Border connections for nested components
- Hover effects for better interactivity
- Child count indicators `[2 children]`
- Proper component naming fallbacks
